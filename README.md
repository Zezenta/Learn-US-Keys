# NerdRacer

NerdRacer is a small MonkeyType kind of keyboard speedometer that measures your code writing speed.

This is a project I made mainly for learning React, TailwindCSS, Vite and some GitHub Actions.

# A Code Typing Racer?

I recently changed my keyboard layout to US INTL because it is arguably better for programming.

I do know touch typing, so I thought about making a Keybr with code snippets, but I realized it would be slightly more fun to make an actual code racing app.

# Typing Speed =/= Coding Competency

This is just a small game btw. Most code is written by AI nowadays. This isnÂ´t a statement that typing fast makes you a competent programmer.
